    <h1 class="service">Talent Management Services</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Talent Management is the art and science of identifying the right people who will propel the organisation to the 
      next stage of growth and beyond. Successful organizations rely on having the right people in the right place at the 
      right time. The process goes beyond identifying and parsing resumes that match a job description and facilitating the 
      selection process. In many cases, especially with the growth of start-ups and new business delivery methods, there is 
      a need to identify the necessary competencies and hard skills that can be brought in for a specific role. Also, the 
      need to develop frameworks that can be used to build models for compensation, and growth management of team members. 
      The complexity increases exponentially as organizations grow and expand regionally and globally, where the talent 
      management challenge has to ensure skills and capability is available to support this growth and expansion. We can 
      deliver Executive Search, Contingency Search, Compensation benchmarking, Outplacement services, Competency based 
      Assessment frameworks, Processes for onboarding & induction amongst other things. Our talent management capability 
      integrates well with our development solutions to provide seamless employee lifecycle support to clients.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Talent Management</h1>
    <p>The Daksada team has a cumulative experience of over 100 man-years in the UAE and the Middle East region within the 
      talent management space. We bring a unique understanding of the cultural nuances and the specific intangible needs of 
      companies and their management. Most of our customers work exclusively with us and have been engaged for five years or 
      more – a remarkable achievement given the intense competition in Executive Search and Contingency Based Search. This is 
      also the single biggest factor that sets us apart from most other mid-sized recruitment agencies in the UAE. We have a 
      direct access to the C-suite of the largest and fastest growing companies in the UAE and a deep knowledge-based 
      relationship that transcends time.
      <br>
      Our Talent Management services exceed what a typical recruitment agency in the UAE can deliver. We have in-house 
      expertise and experience in delivering strategic plans and executional interventions across organisational 
      development, succession management, manpower planning, candidate assessment protocols and centres, leadership 
      development programmes, onboarding programme design and implementation, apart from the specializations in executive 
      search & talent acquisition. Our impact on the process of bringing talent into the fold starts much before the hiring 
      process and continues for some time after.</p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering Strategic Talent Management Services</h1>
      <p>The last few years have seen many mid and large sized organisations build internal teams for recruitment under the 
        overall offering of their respective Human Resources functions. Most have realised that their intake is not constant 
        and that there are periods in the year where recruitment teams are underutilised and have therefore started working 
        with us through an outsourcing contract to manage recruitment through a dedicated team. Further, our clients have 
        also seen value in the fact that we have provided candidates who not just confirm to the skills and experience 
        required of a job role, but also will be a better fit to the culture and team spirit thereby being able to hit the 
        ground running faster. 
        <br>
        Going ahead, team members will take advantage of upgrading skill, learning, and personality development 
        opportunities and work with mentors to grow into roles of increasing responsibility, in turn helping others to do 
        the same. We work closely with the leadership structure to ensure a close bond between them and to facilitate 
        understanding of each other’s roles and thereby work better as a team. We also have expertise in setting up best in 
        class policies and processes that serve a guiding light to the organisational functioning and facilitate employee 
        growth.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To The Business Transformation Process</h1>
      <p>The impact of interventions around people are felt immediately in some cases, and in others over a 6-24 month 
        period. In some cases the measurability of the impact is apparent only after a certain period has elapsed, 
        especially in the case of learning and development initiatives. Keeping this truth in mind, we offer to take a part 
        of the project remuneration on the achievement of pre-determined success metrics. We believe that the Client or 
        Customers success is truly ours given the spirit of partnership that is central to the way we work. We are perhaps 
        among the very few who are open to indexing a part of our compensation to the success metrics that measure the 
        impact of the business transformation process.</p>
