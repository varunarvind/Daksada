    <h1 class="service">Human Capital Management Solutions</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Human Capital Management Solutions are built on an organization's greatest asset, its people. Everyone has an equal 
      contribution to the company's success... People who lead and manage, people  who create and work in teams, people who 
      design and develop,  people who produce and operate,  people who service and sell, and  people who buy and to ruin it 
      is a well known principle that "Every business is about people". With this idea at the heart of our human capital management solutions, we strive to produce added value in the field of strategic HR management. Our expertise is "making things happen" by creating human capital strategies that are people-centric and drive business. The success of a company depends entirely on the motivation that its people bring to work every day. The best  systems, processes, practices, equipment and infrastructure will not help achieve ambitions unless they are staffed by people who believe in the future of the organization and are committed to doing their best  to achieve success. Only when people combine their success with the success of the organization will we see a win-win situation. As space experts, we strive to build a platform for organizational success with the help of its greatest asset, people.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Human Capital Management Solutions</h1>
    <p>We know that merely adopting the best in class solutions may not be suitable for your organization – it is unique, 
      and this must be reflected in the solution. This is why we go above and beyond and define and develop customized and 
      specific solutions to suit your unique Organization. That is not all, we are in for the long term, staying with you 
      till we have achieved your goals, and have handed over a sustainable solution that is institutionalized and embedded 
      within the business.
      <br>
      This gives us a unique edge amongst peers and makes us the trusted and preferred Human Capital partner for Business 
      and Human Resource Leaders. What’s more, our engagement approach includes becoming a trusted partner to your people 
      at all levels, allowing us to weave your unique DNA and culture into solutions and implementation plans. Our tailored 
      solutions are co-created to ensure we have maximum buy in to drive implementation thus bringing about real and lasting 
      change that in turn delivers business results.</p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering Human Capital Management Solutions</h1>
      <p>The last few years have seen many mid and large sized organisations build internal teams for recruitment under the 
        overall offering of their respective Human Resources functions. Most have realised that their intake is not 
        constant and that there are periods in the year where recruitment teams are underutilised and have therefore 
        started working with us through an outsourcing contract to manage recruitment through a dedicated team. Further, 
        our clients have also seen value in the fact that we have provided candidates who not just confirm to the skills 
        and experience required of a job role, but also will be a better fit to the culture and team spirit thereby being 
        able to hit the ground running faster. 
        <br>
        Going ahead, team members will take advantage of upgrading skill, learning, and personality development 
        opportunities and work with mentors to grow into roles of increasing responsibility, in turn helping others to do 
        the same. We work closely with the leadership structure to ensure a close bond between them and to facilitate 
        understanding of each other’s roles and thereby work better as a team. We also have expertise in setting up best in 
        class policies and processes that serve a guiding light to the organisational functioning and facilitate employee 
        growth. </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To The Human Capital Management Solutions</h1>
      <p>As a team we believe in putting our money behind our expertise and effort. Therefore, we offer to index a part of 
        the project compensation on the success of the outcome. This comes from a true sense of a shared ownership of the 
        Human Capital Strategy and its impact on the future of the organisation. In the same spirit we also understand that 
        a solid and strategic solution will require action by multiple specialists strengthen the overall offering. Which 
        is why at Daksada we have representation from talent acquisition & retention, learning & development, and internal 
        communications experts who help round-off and strengthen the overall offering and work towards educating, training, 
        and informing the body of people who form the organisation.</p>
