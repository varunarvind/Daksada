    <h1 class="service">Learning Solutions</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Learning solutions are at the forefront of every company's development work. It is an ongoing process to ensure that 
      an organization's greatest asset, its people, are always ready to grow into more responsible positions and perform 
      their roles rigorously. Functional people have technical skills that enable them to do their jobs better and lay the 
      groundwork for growth in leadership positions. At these stages, it is also necessary to assess and guide those who 
      are ready for higher roles and develop their soft skills such as people management, change management, team building, 
      training, communication and leadership. For managers and senior executives, there are advanced degree programs that 
      influence strategic thinking, business acumen and lead them to general management or C-suite positions. It is 
      important that a learning mindset forms the core of an organization's DNA to act as the grease on the wheels of 
      progress and growth. Each team member must feel taken care of by the curriculum and programs, with the help of 
      dedicated mentors and coaches, so that they feel ready for the role even before they are assigned. In fact, from an 
      organizational perspective, growth should be designed to be an obvious result of planned learning and development; 
      thinking that this has contributed to the leadership and respect of many global organizations.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Learning Solutions</h1>
    <p>The Daksada team has over 40 man-years of experience in planning, curating, and delivering training programmes 
      across employee and management levels. We have access to a rich host of experienced trainers with specific skill 
      sets who have attained mastery over niche programmes as also generalists and skill-based specialists. We also help 
      in re-skilling those who are looking at changing roles or are contemplating a career change.
      <br>
      Daksada also represents many world-renowned international trainers who are sought after by middle and senior 
      management personnel who wish to gain an edge over their peers and further their careers. The increase in emphasis 
      toward digital learning ensures that learning is quick, uninterrupted, and personalized. Daksada can develop and 
      deploy a specifically crafted comprehensive learning management platform, digital learning library & micro-learning 
      platform to roll-out programmes and track performance through intuitive analytics.
    <br>
    Like with all other facets of the versatile bouquet of solutions that Daksada is known for, the creation of a strategic 
    Learning Solution starts with an understanding of the business, structure, systems, and policies. Post this ground work, 
    we look at selecting between multiple hypothesis through deep engagements and interactions with senior management, 
    business & functional leads, and high-low performers to be able to set benchmarks and expectations. Basis the 
    identified problem or opportunity, a blended learning programme is put into place based on competency benchmarks for 
    the function x level matrix. The rigorous implementation and measurement of participation and positive change is 
    indexed to individual and team performance and analytics used to drive continuous process improvement.
    </p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering Strategic Learning Solutions</h1>
      <p>We have always acted on a ‘Build – Operate – Transfer’ model that requires participation by an internal team at 
        all stages of the problem / opportunity identification, solution design, implementation, and measurement/analytics 
        steps of the process. This allows us to work closely with an identified team that will carry the torch forward by 
        donning the mantle of trainers and mentors for successive generations. This, in our experience, is the best way to 
        ensure a strong foundation of learning, one that reaches all aspects of an organisation and percolates to every 
        team member, even those who are not in revenue generation roles. We closely engage through the lifecycle of the 
        programme to manage the minutiae and steer the operative teams firmly in the direction of the overall vision and 
        the attainment of measurable business linked goals.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To Developing a Sales Excellence Mindset</h1>
      <p>Learning is a continuous process, and such programmes are typically implemented over a 6-18-month period after 
        which measurable results are available. Given the gestation period and the specificity of results expected, we 
        normally index a part of the project compensation on achievement of the expected outcome. In the spirit of 
        partnership that is central to the way we work; we believe that the Client or Customers success is truly ours. 
        It is this that separates us from the other practitioners in this region.</p>
