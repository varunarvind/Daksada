    <h1 class="service">Cost Reduction</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Cost reduction is the highest priority now. It is difficult for companies to maintain their profits because 
      revenues and cash flows are unpredictable. In good times, most organizations pay no real attention to cost 
      management other than the management of acquired materials. In the current situation, companies must look at all 
      possible savings opportunities and try to make driving more efficient at every level and remove all unnecessary 
      luxuries. 
      <br>
      In the process of reducing costs, it is important to evaluate and apply scientific rigor and not make arbitrary 
      cuts that can have a negative impact on the company both in the short and long term. In many cases, hidden or 
      associated costs only become apparent  when changes are made to processes, systems, practices or people without 
      proper planning and foresight. Delta's impact on any of the four pillars of the business is sometimes 
      disproportionate to the apparent cost savings, so the process must be managed carefully and judiciously.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Delivering Cost Reduction</h1>
    <p>Daksada has experience in delivering and embedding Lean Management in spirit and practice across the organisation 
      just the way the Japanese have applied over several decades across organisation size and industry types. We have over 
      30 man-years of experience in looking at people related policies and processes, recruitment, and development that 
      invite cost saving into the thinking, planning, and performance of employees. We go beyond the obvious focus of most 
      businesses – the direct costs including head count. In our experience, far too many organizations look at human capital 
      with an accounting mindset, and consider the savings in wages from reduced headcount as a saving to the bottom line. 
      All too often, this does not pan out as intended, with businesses seeing an erosion of capability that ultimately 
      results in reduced performance, customer dissatisfaction and finally in greater losses. Our approach instead is to 
      consider ‘hidden’ or not so obvious areas where waste is found, or unrealised savings and improvements abound. Our 
      focus on processes effectively frees up resource, eliminates waste and drives growth and efficiency resulting in an 
      upward spiral for the business. Given that such ideas need to be constantly reinforced and success recognized to 
      encourage others, we also round off this offering with a strength in helping communications reach across 
      organisations. 
     <br>
     Our approach to serving clients starts with an understanding of the ‘as is’ processes, architecture, and resource 
     levels. Our experience and expertise allows us to identify opportunities for improvement, savings, efficiencies, waste 
     elimination, all of which ultimately enable the business to benefit significantly both in terms of reduced costs as 
     well as enhanced output, thus positively impacting business results.
    </p>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To Cost Reduction</h1>
      <p>It is obvious that an organisation will need to invest in the immediate term to deliver reduced cost operations in 
        that continue to arrogate benefits over the long term. We are happy to stake a part of the project compensation on 
        the savings achieved over the term of the process. This is an open offer mindful of the fact that such interventions 
        often need 6-12 months from problem identification to arriving at measurable success factors. We believe that the 
        Client or Customers success is truly ours given the spirit of partnership that is central to the way we work. We 
        are perhaps among the very few who are open to indexing a part of our compensation to the success metrics that 
        measure the impact of the business transformation process.
