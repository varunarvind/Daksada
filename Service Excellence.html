    <h1 class="service">Service Excellence</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>The importance of service excellence has increased over the last 10-15 years due to the increase in customer 
      connections provided by the Internet and rapidly evolving technologies. The lines are blurred and each must provide a 
      "service" to attract new customers and most importantly maintain an existing franchise throughout its life. In many 
      organizations, the spirit of service is reflected in all aspects of internal and external engagements - from the first 
      greeting emails to face-to-face meetings and contracts. Putting the customer first is an attitude that can be learned, 
      embedded in systems and processes, and refined in practice over time. 
      <br>
      Official research has shown anecdotal data that "service" is one of the most popular reasons for customer 
      dissatisfaction. On the other hand, it also stands out as the biggest single motivation when interviewing clients 
      with long-term relationships and analyzing the data obtained. Therefore, a well-rooted service focus at all levels 
      of the organization is extremely important, because hidden benefits are aligned with commercial benefits, even when 
      environmental or market conditions have made customers look for alternative service providers, especially as an 
      opportunity. to save costs. Looking at the evidence of customer relationship management (CRM) campaigns, wisdom shows 
      that acquiring a new customer costs 4 times more than keeping an existing customer.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Service Excellence</h1>
    <p>Daksada is one of the best practitioners to deliver true Service Excellence to organisations. We have extensive 
      experience in being able to impact all three levers – people, policies, and processes. We offer a unique meld of 
      consultation and training protocols that enable the rank and file to adopt a measurable service attitude. These 
      include the impact on process in terms of the time taken and cost, to the human level interactions, and delve deeply 
      into policies that codify and standardize expectations. 
      <br>
      Service is one of the areas where one experiences Gestalt as it is the one aspect of an organisations engagement with 
      consumers that is truly greater than a mathematical cumulation of many small steps. More so as the steps are dependent 
      on the interaction of two individuals and therefore cannot be easily codified into measurable outcomes that can be 
      repeated again and again. We understand the human side of the equation as well as the science offered by systems, 
      processes, and policies, thereby being able to arrive at pointed interventions that impact all aspects of the status 
      quo. It is this strength that allows us to stand apart from the many other practitioners who offer standardised 
      solutions as compared to our customised offering.
    <br>
    Like with all other facets of the versatile bouquet of solutions that Daksada is known for, the creation of a strategic 
    Learning Solution starts with an understanding of the business, structure, systems, and policies. Post this ground work, 
    we look at selecting between multiple hypothesis through deep engagements and interactions with senior management, 
    business & functional leads, and high-low performers to be able to set benchmarks and expectations. Basis the 
    identified problem or opportunity, a blended learning programme is put into place based on competency benchmarks for 
    the function x level matrix. The rigorous implementation and measurement of participation and positive change is 
    indexed to individual and team performance and analytics used to drive continuous process improvement.
    </p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering Strategic Learning Solutions</h1>
      <p>In rebuilding the triumvirate of people, processes, and policies, our customers have felt the full power of the 
        partnership model at Daksada. We have delivered impact and renewed organisational commitment to achieving and 
        scaling to higher standards of Service Excellence through a cross pollination of ideas and executional strength 
        between all our practices. Our strengths in the People Practice complement the Talent Management team and combine 
        with the abilities of the Learning & Development practice to conceive and implement a solution that ensures the 
        biggest impact with minimal rewiring. We have a proven track record in building a sustainable Service Excellence 
        ethos in organisations as diverse as manufacturing, banking & financial services, engineering, retail, and oil 7 
        gas. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To Developing a Sales Excellence Mindset</h1>
      <p>The process of building a solution aimed at delivering Service Excellence is like weaving a tapestry. The warp and 
        weft of the myriad interventions that combine to arrive at a personalised or curated response is what keeps us 
        happy – It allows us to involve each of our practice leads and bring on the full force of their individual 
        experiences.
        <br>
        Extending the spirit of partnership to our customers, we are happy to take a part of the project compensation on 
        achieving stated metrics. We have truly internalised the idea that our Customer’s success is truly ours, and vice 
        versa. No wonder, we are perhaps among the very few who are open to indexing a part of our compensation to the 
        success metrics that measure the impact of the business transformation process.
