        <h1 class="about-us">About Us</h1>
        <p>Our solutions are based on our core belief that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Teams and organizations 
        that want to realize the true potential of the truth in the Gestalt Theory can do so, provided they get critical 
        organizational aspects right – Strategy, Structure, and Systems – the 3S model that Daksada works on. Our capability 
        is built around this 3S Model to deliver value to our clients by helping them develop these all-important facets. 
        Our mission is to be the preferred partner to business leaders to getting these critical fundamentals institutionalized, 
        in order for these businesses to achieve their true potential in terms of growth, profitability, and success. Our unique 
        Partner’s Framework makes us one of the few business consultants in the UAE who bring multiple subject matter experts 
        together to collaborate and work towards addressing a customer challenge or maximising an available innovation 
        opportunity. We deliver best in class solutions by applying the wisdom of the collective to define a specifically 
        crafted solution, and backing it with world-class execution, we offer businesses the opportunity to transform themselves 
        and reset their trajectory onto the growth path. Our experienced team of partners cumulatively bring 150+ years of 
        hands-on experience in their respective fields – not many other business consultants in the UAE present such a strong 
        field of industry veterans. As senior professionals who have impacted the growth in organisations across industries, 
        we understand the drivers of growth in the Middle East markets, and the cultural levers that facilitate the same. 
        Simply put, Daksada’s purpose is to close the ‘skill’ or ‘competency’ gap in organisations. This purpose is best 
        explained by our name itself: ’Daks’ ( /daksh/ ) means ‘skill or ability’, and ‘Da’ ( /da/ ) means ‘to give’. 
        We work with companies who are setting the stage for their next growth leap through a transformation mindset. 
        As business consultants in the UAE, we partner in the process of transformation by offering a choice on the form of e
        ngagement – as a consultant, advisor, implementation partner, or a combination thereof. Further, we offer engagements 
        at a flat fee, time-cost basis, milestone based, result based, or a convenient meld of these. We partner with clients 
        over the long term, staying committed till they achieve their goals, and even linking some of our fees to the benefits 
        our clients realize.</p>

      <p class="talent-management-parapgraph">Led by the passionate and indomitable Ruth Fernandes, the Daksada Talent 
        Management Team has the distinction of being one of the few Executive Search firms in the UAE to have placed a good 
        number of people at senior management roles across the Middle East markets. If you do not believe us, do walk up to your 
        colleagues, and ask if they know Ruth – we will be very surprised if they have not heard of her. Ruth is ably partnered 
        by Lorraine Fernandez, Amreen Khan, and Saikat Mukherjee, (in alphabetical order), who together bring in ~45 years of 
        enthusiasm (on top of Ruth’s 30 years in the business) in their always-on quest to connect the dots and find happiness 
        for the candidate and the hiring managers. Drop-in for a coffee (or tea if you prefer) and see the bonhomie in the team.
        See the zest with which they go about their ‘job’ under Ruth’s benevolent mentorship and guidance – you will always find 
        the room filled with conversation and a free 
        exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p class="People-Practice-Paragraph">Our People Practice is led by two industry veterans who complement each other like the Yin & Yang. 
          Muthukrishna Moorthi from the southern part of India readily acknowledges that Leon Mendonsa, (who traces his roots to 
          Mumbai), is the perfect counterfoil to his style and personality. Together they create a formidable team of combined 
          and balanced experience and expertise who can take on any other team of Human Resource consultants with their ability 
          to tailor-make solutions. Given that it is people that the eponymous ‘People Practice’ team deal with, People are at 
          the very centre of all solutions and interventions. Our approach is rooted in running a diagnostic, then testing our 
          hypothesis through data, research, and by speaking to key stakeholders so that the solution arrived at is anchored in 
          the organisational culture. More importantly, the elegance of the solution lies in the fact that it based on a deep 
          understanding of human behaviour, backed by years of hands on experience with large, diverse organizations. The People 
          Practice team brings rigour to the process and depth to the solution, reflecting contemporary best practices and using 
          the latest in tools, technology, and methodologies, and set themselves apart from the average HR Consultant.</p>
