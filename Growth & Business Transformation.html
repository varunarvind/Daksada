    <h1 class="service">Growth & Business Transformation</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Growth and change are interchangeable as cause and effect and are the eternal goal of every business owner and manager. 
    With  rapidly accelerating changes, businesses today must constantly evolve to survive and thrive and stay ahead of the 
    competition. As Charles Darwin so eloquently said: "It is not the strongest  species that survives, nor the most 
    intelligent. It is the one that is best adapted to change." Many organizations have overlooked the value of periodically 
    reassessing and realigning their strategy, value proposition, practices and practices. The effect of such thinking is not 
    felt when business begins to flourish, but it appears when  environmental conditions begin to impose. A company with strong 
    foundations and agility grows stronger regardless of  external and internal forces. It is therefore imperative that 
    companies constantly reassess themselves and strengthen their fundamentals by focusing on better processes, practices and 
    people to lead them to a better tomorrow.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s approach to business transformation</h1>
    <p>At Daksada, our business transformation consulting framework for organizations is firmly rooted in our articulated belief 
      that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Our experts jointly have more than 150 man years of expertise in c
      rafting and delivering business transformation services to help organizations grow and transform – whether small or large, 
      start-ups or centenarians, local or international, and across the breadth of industries and sectors. We bring the collective 
      wisdom of these years of experience to our clients, knowing that while we base our solutions on best in class practices, 
      each organization is unique, and deserves a bespoke and tailored intervention. We follow a few simple mantras – stay focused 
      on direction; avoid pitfalls and obstacles; ensure that the execution and strategy are nimble and agile.</p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering A Transformed Business</h1>
      <p>It is when working with clients on growth and transformation interventions that the true combined power of Daksada is 
      realized – a perfect coming together of the entire breadth of our capability spectrum to curate a wholistic and integrated 
      solution for our clients. We use the client’s vision, mission and values as the launch pad to co-create a strategy, 
      collectively challenge the status quo, reengineer processes, redesign the organization architecture, refresh the talent 
      proposition, develop capability, and then partner with the client team to implement, measure and monitor success, while 
      embedding and institutionalizing the change to ensure ongoing and sustainable growth. Our communication framework wraps 
      around our efforts, to ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page. In many cases, the transformation process is 
      achieved via the cumulative impact of a series of well-orchestrated steps is over 6-24 months, or more, depending on the 
      scale of the organization and the depth of the issue or opportunity. In most cases, in our experience, the agreement of 
      the strategy and the implementation of the process related changes is not the end of the road. It is very important to 
      address the human side of the organization and bring the team on-board through updation in policies and people related 
      practices and supplant the same with training and mentoring. There is also the need for constant communication and 
      engagement across all levels of the organization’s hierarchy to build belief and confidence in the present and its 
      impact on the future.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To The Business</h1>
      <p>We are happy to stake a part of the project compensation on the success of the outcome in the true spirit of a shared 
        ownership of the strategy and the result. We believe that the Client or Customers success is truly ours given the spirit 
        of partnership that is central to the way we work. We are perhaps among the very few who are open to indexing a part of 
        our compensation to the success metrics that measure the impact of the business transformation process.</p>
