    <h1 class="service">Business Process Improvement</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Improving business processes with an always-on approach to doing better than yesterday. This requires an open-minded 
      approach that wants to strip all processes down to the basics and then see if they can be put together more effectively and efficiently. The idea to improve business processes could be to save costs, improve information management, increase speed and efficiency, reduce labor time or lead time, etc. For services offered through a web or application interface, an event related to a business process can often be the difference between a repeat customer and a one-time customer. 
      A businessman or manager must let go of the belief that things have worked well and the belief that things cannot be 
      improved. A system or process can have many unnecessary elements, even those that unnecessarily duplicate the 
      collection, measurement or control of information. There may be better ways to acquire, store, ship or do any other 
      business. It is imperative that the business owner be open to the idea of ​​occasionally examining the nuts and bolts of 
      operations and seeing if they can be strengthened against future business pressures.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Talent Management</h1>
    <p>At Daksada, we are equipped with the ability to ask the right questions and use data and process flow diagrams to 
      look for ways to augment the same and draw in effectiveness. The impact of such interventions could be far reaching 
      and could deliver huge savings to the bottom-line and hence generate additional profits without incurring cost. We 
      have team members who have hands-on experience in conceiving and implementing Lean Strategies, especially for 
      manufacturing, retail, supply chain, construction, and service industries. 
      <br>
      Lean strategies and manufacturing or other processes are gaining criticality in an increasingly mechanised world. 
      For many decades after the industrial revolution industries and businesses grew because of large availability of 
      relatively cheap labour. Today the need for speed and the democratised access to information required a huge 
      dependence on data, information, and the resultant insights that have a direct impact on better processes at a lower 
      cost.</p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering Business Process Improvement</h1>
      <p>Our interventions begin with understanding the customer and business through a value stream mapping process. We 
        engage with client teams through a series of structured interventions through which we together challenge the 
        status quo and co-create an improved process, building ownership of the solution. We focus on transferring the 
        capability of managing business process improvement to client teams and institutionalize the process, so the team 
        delivers continuous improvement going forward. Our engagement continues with documenting the reengineered processes 
        and implementing them. We demonstrate results by putting in place scorecards that capture key process metrics that 
        allow the business to track the before and after performance levels and ensure that the benefits are maintained on 
        a sustained basis.
        <br>
        Perhaps the biggest differentiator we bring is the expertise in training team members at all levels in both 
        developing skills and improving the softer sides of the human capital. This facet enables team members to 
        internalise the changes in the new ways they work and become active proponents of the need to constantly look at 
        better methods and processes. This is critical as people are often resistant to change and need to be mentored in 
        order to accept and gain proficiency over time. Perhaps the criticality of training is best illustrated in service 
        oriented companies that need to rewire processes to effect efficiencies and manage greater loads, especially during 
        times like the pandemic where customers have found it convenient to migrate towards online and contactless means of 
        buying.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our impact in Delivering Business Process Improvement</h1>
      <p>The impact of interventions around people are felt immediately in some cases, and in others over a 6-24 month 
        period. In some cases the measurability of the impact is apparent only after a certain period has elapsed, 
        especially in the case of learning and development initiatives. Keeping this truth in mind, we offer to take a part 
        of the project remuneration on the achievement of pre-determined success metrics. We believe that the Client or 
        Customers success is truly ours given the spirit of partnership that is central to the way we work. We are perhaps 
        among the very few who are open to indexing a part of our compensation to the success metrics that measure the 
        impact of the business transformation process.</p>
        <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To The Business transformation Process</h1>
        <p>We are happy to stake a part of the project compensation on the success of the outcome in the true spirit of a 
          shared ownership of the strategy and the result. We believe that the Client or Customers success is truly ours 
          given the spirit of partnership that is central to the way we work. We are perhaps among the very few who are 
          open to indexing a part of our compensation to the success metrics that measure the impact of the business 
          transformation process.</p>
