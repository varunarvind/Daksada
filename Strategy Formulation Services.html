    <p>Strategizing is the cornerstone of success in the business world. Someone wisely defined a strategy to make the optimal 
      choice given many factors and constraints. Experienced professionals agree that there are many different ways to solve a 
      problem or maximize an opportunity, and the addition of time and technology only increases the number of viable options 
      available. As business owners or managers, the onus is on you to evaluate the available options and determine one 
      "strategy" to follow and then align all actions to achieve success. Strategy is first defined at the corporate or 
      corporate brand level, then allowed to spread across brands, departments or functions, keeping the core of each goal and 
      adding functions essential to efficiency and effectiveness. After that comes the phase of building and maintaining trust 
      in each team member, regardless of their task or position, to collectively contribute to the achievement of the goals with 
      in the allotted time.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksadaâ€™s Approach To Strategy Formulation</h1>
    <p>At Daksada, we bring in a fresh perspective to any problem or help you reimagine opportunities in a way that augments 
      your business and operations. We believe in a co-ownership of the strategy and look at delivering what works for a company, 
      business, brand, operational process structure, and organisational culture. We work closely with the management, line 
      managers and staff to ensure that the strategy development and subsequent implementation takes into consideration all the 
      moving parts and the many hands that will drive the outcome.
      <br>
      Our approach allows business owners and leaders to articulate a vision, engages with key stakeholders to co-create and 
      document a detailed strategy and roadmap to implementation including organization architecture, resource requirements, 
      capability development, and processes. This is supported by performance scorecards that allow businesses to measure and 
      monitor achievements, from which cascade department, functional and eventually individual performance scorecards thus 
      ensuring that the business performance metrics are built into the individual performance management process. Our approach 
      to communicating through the process or strategy formulation and execution ensures that all stakeholders are aligned, 
      helping to focus and direct energy towards corporate results.</p>
      <h1>The Impact Of Strategy Formulation</h1>
      <p>A Strategy is like a belief system. Every member of the organisation needs to be wired into the strategy and perform 
        her or his role as if the fulfilment of the strategy is dependent on them. The strategy needs to be real and palpable, 
        so that individuals, teams, and the whole organisation works in tandem to exceed the targets outlined for a period so 
        that they may be on track for the achievement of the long-term objectives. Strategy necessarily relies on metrics and 
        therefore allows people to break the larger target into smaller steps that may be achieved by following systems and 
        processes, training people to grow and deliver, and managing course corrections to cater to internal and external 
        factors. 
        <br>
        The task does not end with strategy formulation. In many ways that is the genesis of the evolution of an organisation 
        into a future-proof business with strong fundamentals. Once the strategy is articulated, it needs to be broken down by 
        functions, departments, teams, and then individual KPIs. This will allow a business manager to look at gaps in staffing 
        and skill levels as also identify the training and mentorship required to create space for people to grow into roles in 
        the future. There might be the need to bring in talent from outside to close gaps where necessary so that new thinking 
        can help accelerate action. Needless to say, it is imperative that the culture of an organisation be maintained and 
        strengthened through such periods, a mandate that is managed at multiple levels through learning & development 
        initiatives, engagement programmes and constant internal communication around successes that everyone can take credit 
        for.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To The Strategy</h1>
      <p>We are happy to stake a part of the project compensation on the success of the outcome in the true spirit of a shared 
        ownership of the strategy and the result. We believe that the Client or Customers success is truly ours given the spirit 
        of partnership that is central to the way we work. We are perhaps among the very few who are open to indexing a part of 
        our compensation to the success metrics that measure the impact of the business transformation process.</p>
