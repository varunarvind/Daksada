    <h1 class="service">Sales Excellence</h1>
   <div class="service-container">
    <p>Sales excellence is achieved by working with people, tools and processes. Both in-house and outsourced sales teams 
      must be equipped with the right information to communicate the features and benefits of products or services and 
      convert prospects into customers. In addition, they must be trained to manage the sales process and engage customers, 
      as they are the first point of contact  and must provide a positive experience. After this stage, sales required 
      customer engagement and the first sale that initiates a lasting relationship in terms of upsells, cross-sells, 
      referrals, service packages, etc. Each of these points initiates a new process and depends on the use of a number of 
      engagement facilitation tools that  can be measured in terms of effectiveness and cost. In today's hyper-connected 
      world, companies want to create seamless connections across real, virtual and digital customer interfaces so that the 
      experience is consistent and continuous, and can be moved at their convenience. This increases the pressure on 
      companies, teams, systems and processes, as the demands for scalability and flexibility often conflict with the deep 
      need and dependence of people. We would all  prefer to communicate with a person at the end of the phone, or better
       yet, with someone sitting at a desk. The reality is that much of the communication comes from the interface, which 
       adds stress to the person  tasked with managing and nurturing relationships on behalf of the organization.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Daksada’s Approach to Sales Excellence</h1>
    <p>At Daksada, we are equipped with the ability to ask the right questions and use data and process flow diagrams to 
      look for ways to augment the same and draw in effectiveness. The impact of such interventions could be far reaching 
      and could deliver huge savings to the bottom-line and hence generate additional profits without incurring cost. We 
      have team members who have hands-on experience in conceiving and implementing Lean Strategies, especially for 
      manufacturing, retail, supply chain, construction, and service industries. 
      <br>
      Lean strategies and manufacturing or other processes are gaining criticality in an increasingly mechanised world. 
      For many decades after the industrial revolution industries and businesses grew because of large availability of 
      relatively cheap labour. Today the need for speed and the democratised access to information required a huge 
      dependence on data, information, and the resultant insights that have a direct impact on better processes at a lower 
      cost.</p>
      <h1>Our Impact In Delivering a Sales Excellence Mindset</h1>
      <p>Our cumulative experience gained across multiple Sales excellence programmes conceived and administered across 
        organisations of different employee strengths and industry verticals has ensured a high confidence in the 
        applicability of curated programmes as against a one size fits all approach taken by many other experts and 
        practitioners. We have seen a definitive uptick in the hard and soft performance parameters stretching across 
        revenue, customer happiness scores, and the ability of team members to engage with customers through empathy and a 
        listening attitude thereby delivering a win-win experience for both.
        <br>
        We have always advocated the implementation of such curated blended learning programmes as a continuous engagement 
        so that there is a learning culture embedded in the sales team and successive generations of team members feel the 
        impact over the period of their career. We have seen that Sales Excellence training often is seen as a strong point 
        to bring in the best in high potential talent into the organisation and then convert them into trainers for new 
        cohorts.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Our Partnership Perspective To Developing a Sales Excellence Mindset</h1>
      <p>Our confidence is such that we are ready to peg a part of our project remuneration on the success of the outcome. 
        In many ways, this reflects the true spirit of a shared ownership of the strategy, the process, and the result. 
        In this part of the world, we are perhaps among the very few who are open to indexing a part of our compensation 
        to the success metrics that measure the impact of the sales excellence intervention.</p>
